# IDAO21
Here is my code that was written during IDAO21. IDAO (International Data Analysis Olympiad) - ML-competition where each team should teach model, and then they will be tested on public and private tests. The next stage was the Final, but we hadn't qualified.

I want to add some comments and explanations because there are a lot of interesting things.
For example, it is possible to "hack" their checker using two extra submissions.
It means that we could figure out our accuracy and therefore have known AUC ROC.

Also, I needed to extract some characteristic values from images. So I have divided a picture into 49 squares and then have
realized something like a bfs with a step that I controlled.

All this stuff I am going to explain in few weeks
